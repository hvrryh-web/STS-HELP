## Quantizing Economics Terms

### A

**Amplitude, Probability**  
In quantum mechanics, the square of a probability amplitude gives the probability of an outcome. In quantum economics, used to model decision probabilities with interference effects.

**Artifact (Economics)**  
Not to be confused with the STS mechanic; in economics, an artifact is an unintended consequence or measurement error in models.

### B

**Born Rule**  
Quantum mechanics principle that the probability of measuring a particular outcome is the square of the amplitude of its wave function. Applied in Quantum Decision Theory.

**Bubbles (Economic)**  
Asset price bubbles where prices exceed intrinsic value. Quantum economics models these as emergent states arising from entangled market behavior.

### C

**Classical Probability**  
Traditional probability theory based on Kolmogorov axioms. Assumes mutually exclusive outcomes and additive probabilities. Contrasts with quantum probability.

**Collapse (Wave Function)**  
In quantum mechanics, when a measurement is made, the superposition of states "collapses" to a definite outcome. In quantum economics, represents the moment a transaction fixes a price.

**Complex Numbers**  
Numbers with real and imaginary parts (a + bi). Essential for quantum probability amplitudes, which can interfere constructively or destructively.

### D

**Disjunction Effect**  
A violation of the "sure-thing principle" where people's choices depend on whether they know the outcome of an uncertain event, even when the choice should be the same either way. QDT naturally models this.

### E

**Entanglement (Economic)**  
A quantum-inspired concept where economic agents, markets, or variables are interconnected such that the state of one instantaneously affects others. Used to model systemic risk and market contagion.

**Expected Utility Theory**  
Classical economic theory where agents maximize expected utility. Often fails to explain real human behavior; QDT provides an alternative framework.

### H

**Hilbert Space**  
A mathematical space used in quantum mechanics to represent quantum states. In quantum economics and QDT, used to represent cognitive states, preferences, or market conditions.

### I

**Interference (Quantum)**  
When probability amplitudes combine, they can interfere constructively (increase probability) or destructively (decrease probability). Explains decision paradoxes in QDT.

### M

**Measurement Effect**  
The principle that observing or measuring a system changes its state. In economics: surveys, policy announcements, or interventions can alter the economy being measured.

### N

**NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum)**  
Current era of quantum computing with limited qubits and high error rates. Quantum finance applications are in the NISQ era, requiring hybrid classical-quantum approaches.

### O

**Operator (Quantum)**  
Mathematical object representing observable quantities or transformations in quantum mechanics. Used in QDT to model decisions and measurements.

### P

**Preference Reversal**  
When people's stated preferences change depending on how they're elicited. A well-known behavioral economics anomaly that QDT explains better than classical theory.

**Propensity (Quantum)**  
A tendency toward a particular outcome that exists prior to measurement but is not deterministic. Used in quantum economics to model latent economic states.

### Q

**Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**  
A quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Applied to portfolio optimization in quantum finance.

**Quantum Decision Theory (QDT)**  
Application of quantum probability and Hilbert space mathematics to model human decision-making, especially paradoxes and context effects.

**Quantum Economics**  
Field applying quantum mechanical concepts (superposition, entanglement, measurement) to economic theory, particularly money, value, and decision-making.

**Quantum Finance**  
Application of quantum computing and quantum probability to financial problems like portfolio optimization, derivative pricing, and risk analysis.

**Quantum Game Theory**  
Extension of classical game theory where players can use quantum strategies (superpositions, entanglement), leading to new equilibria.

**Quantum Probability**  
Non-classical probability allowing for interference effects and contextuality. Used in QDT and quantum economics to model phenomena classical probability cannot explain.

### S

**Superposition (Economic)**  
A quantum-inspired concept where economic actors hold multiple, possibly conflicting, preferences or strategies simultaneously until a decision "collapses" them to one choice.

**Sure-Thing Principle**  
Classical decision theory principle that a choice should be independent of unknown information if the choice is best under all possible outcomes. Often violated in reality; explained by QDT.

### U

**Uncertainty Principle (Economic)**  
By analogy to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the idea that certain economic quantities (e.g., price and value) cannot be known precisely simultaneously, or that measuring one affects the other.

### V

**Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**  
A quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for finding ground states of quantum systems. Applied to optimization problems in quantum finance.

### W

**Wave Function**  
In quantum mechanics, a mathematical description of a quantum state. In quantum economics, used metaphorically to represent the state of economic variables before measurement/transaction.

**Wave-Particle Duality**  
Quantum phenomenon where entities exhibit both wave and particle properties. David Orrell uses this as analogy for money being both physical object and abstract value.

## Cross-Domain Concepts

These concepts appear in both Quantizing Economics and Slay the Spire contexts, highlighting interesting parallels.

### Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

**Economics Context**: Agents must make choices with incomplete information about future outcomes, market states, or other actors' behavior.

**STS Context**: Players must choose cards, paths, and plays without knowing future encounters, card draws, or reward offerings.

**Connection**: Both domains require probabilistic reasoning and risk assessment. Quantum-inspired models may improve decision-making in both.

### Emergent Complexity

**Economics Context**: Market phenomena like bubbles, crashes, and equilibria emerge from interactions of many simple agents.

**STS Context**: Powerful deck strategies emerge from combinations of simple cards and relics that synergize in unexpected ways.

**Connection**: Simple rules can produce complex, unpredictable outcomes. Both systems exhibit non-linear dynamics.

### Entanglement / Interdependence

**Economics Context**: Markets, agents, and variables are interconnected such that changes in one affect others, often non-locally and unpredictably.

**STS Context**: Cards, relics, and game state are interconnected; one card's value depends on others in deck and relics owned.

**Connection**: Individual components cannot be understood in isolation. System behavior requires holistic analysis.

### Measurement Effects

**Economics Context**: Observing or measuring economic variables (via surveys, audits, policy) can alter the system being measured.

**STS Context**: Choosing to add a card or fight an elite "collapses" future possibilities and changes the game state trajectory.

**Connection**: The act of observation/decision is not passive but actively shapes outcomes.

### Path Dependence

**Economics Context**: Current state of an economy depends on historical path taken, not just present conditions. Early decisions constrain future options.

**STS Context**: Current deck state depends on all previous card/relic acquisitions. Early choices (e.g., taking boss relic, removing cards) shape available strategies.

**Connection**: History matters. Optimal choices depend on context established by prior decisions.

### Risk vs. Reward Tradeoffs

**Economics Context**: Investors balance potential returns against downside risk. Higher returns typically require accepting higher risk.

**STS Context**: Players balance HP loss (risk) against acquiring relics from elites (reward). Aggressive pathing risks death but offers better winning chances.

**Connection**: No free lunch. Gains require accepting corresponding risks. Optimal strategy balances both.

### Superposition of Strategies

**Economics Context**: Agents may maintain multiple conflicting preferences or strategies simultaneously until a decision "collapses" to one choice.

**STS Context**: Players maintain flexible deck that could support multiple archetypes until key cards/relics "collapse" strategy to one path.

**Connection**: Keeping options open is valuable. Premature commitment limits adaptability.

### Uncertainty and Probability

**Economics Context**: Future outcomes are fundamentally uncertain. Models must reason probabilistically about distributions of possibilities.

**STS Context**: Card draws, enemy encounters, and rewards are stochastic. Optimal play requires reasoning about probabilities, not certainties.

**Connection**: Deterministic thinking fails. Success requires embracing uncertainty and making probabilistic judgments.

## Usage Notes

### For Researchers

This glossary serves as a bridge between quantum economics theory and practical game strategy analysis. Many concepts have formal mathematical definitions in their respective fields but are presented here in accessible terms.

### For Practitioners

When applying quantum-inspired decision models to Slay the Spire AI, pay attention to cross-domain concepts. The parallels are not superficial but reflect deep structural similarities in decision-making under uncertainty.

### For Developers

Tools built using these concepts should clearly distinguish between:
- **Metaphorical usage** (using quantum concepts as analogies)
- **Mathematical usage** (applying quantum probability formalism)
- **Computational usage** (implementing quantum algorithms)
