# Quantizing Economics: A Comprehensive Overview

## Executive Summary

**Quantizing Economics** (also known as **Quantum Economics**) is an emerging transdisciplinary field that applies the mathematical formalism and conceptual framework of quantum mechanics to economic theory, decision-making, financial modeling, and monetary systems. Unlike classical economics—which models agents as rational, independent optimizers in equilibrium—quantum economics views economic reality as fundamentally uncertain, interdependent (entangled), and subject to measurement effects (where the act of observation influences the system).

## Introduction

### From Classical to Quantum Thinking

Traditional (neoclassical) economics rests on assumptions borrowed from 19th-century physics:

- **Rational agents** maximize utility/profit
- **Markets** tend toward equilibrium
- The economy can be understood via **mechanistic, deterministic models**

Quantum economics replaces these assumptions with quantum-inspired alternatives:

- **Superposition**: Economic actors may hold multiple, even conflicting, preferences or strategies simultaneously—collapsing into a definite choice only at the moment of decision (analogous to quantum measurement)
- **Entanglement**: Actions in one part of the economy can instantaneously influence other parts, making markets deeply interconnected and often unpredictable
- **Uncertainty Principle**: Some economic quantities (price/value, supply/demand) cannot be known precisely at the same time; measuring one may affect the other
- **Interference**: Decisions and possibilities can "interfere" with one another, leading to unexpected outcomes not predicted by classical probability

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Superposition

In quantum physics, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed. In quantum economics:

- Economic agents (individuals, firms) may hold **multiple, conflicting preferences or intentions** at the same time
- Traditional models assume clear, deterministic preferences; quantum economics **embraces ambiguity**
- Example: A consumer may simultaneously value a product highly *and* lowly until the moment of purchase

### 2. Uncertainty Principle

In physics, certain paired properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be precisely measured at once. In economics:

- Some economic variables (e.g., **price and value**, **supply and demand**) may have inherent, irreducible uncertainty
- Prediction models must accept the **limits of precise forecasting**
- Policy interventions or market actions ("measurements") themselves influence outcomes

### 3. Entanglement

Entangled quantum particles affect each other's states instantly, regardless of distance. Applied to economics:

- Markets and agents are **deeply interconnected**
- Shocks or decisions in one market have **ripple effects** elsewhere, often unpredictably
- Financial crises can propagate instantaneously through entangled networks

### 4. Measurement and Collapse

Quantum physics describes outcomes as probabilities until observation ("measurement") collapses the wave function. In economics:

- **Value is indeterminate** until a transaction occurs
- Prices are "collapsed" at the **moment of exchange**—prior to that, they exist only as possibilities
- The act of measurement (e.g., policy intervention, market survey) can alter the system being measured

### 5. Probabilistic Approach

Standard economics often uses deterministic models. Quantum economics:

- Employs **probability amplitudes** and **interference effects**
- Accepts complex, emergent phenomena (e.g., market crashes, bubbles) as natural system states
- Uses quantum probability rather than classical probability to model decision-making

## Quantum Decision Theory (QDT)

### Overview

Quantum Decision Theory applies **Hilbert space mathematics** and **quantum probability** to model how humans actually make choices. It is particularly useful for explaining phenomena that classical decision theory struggles with.

### Key Applications

1. **Preference Reversals**: Why people change their minds or behave inconsistently
2. **The Disjunction Effect**: Violations of the "sure-thing principle" where the outcome of a decision depends on whether context is known
3. **Context-Dependence**: How choices are shaped by framing or prior questions
4. **Order Effects**: When the sequence of questions affects responses

### Mathematical Framework

- Uses **Hilbert spaces** to represent cognitive states
- Applies the **Born Rule** for calculating probabilities
- Models decisions as quantum measurements that collapse superposed preference states

### Empirical Evidence

Research shows QDT can **outperform** classical expected utility theory and prospect theory in explaining experimental data on human choices, particularly for:

- Lottery choice paradoxes
- Risk assessment under uncertainty
- Behavioral economics anomalies

## Quantum Finance and Optimization

### Portfolio Optimization

**Quantum Computing Applications:**

- Algorithms like **VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)** and **QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)** map optimization problems to quantum systems
- Can search solution spaces more efficiently than classical brute force for problems with many assets and complex constraints
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Current "noisy" quantum computers (NISQ era) work best in combination with classical methods

**Pilot Projects:**

- IBM, Vanguard, and JP Morgan have demonstrated viability of quantum-classical optimization for financial portfolios
- Early results show potential speedups for large-scale portfolio problems

### Derivative Pricing

- **Quantum Monte Carlo** methods speed up simulation of derivative payoffs
- Particularly useful for complex derivatives with many underlying variables
- Can reduce computational time for risk calculations

### Market Modeling

Quantum formalism captures phenomena like:

- **Bubbles and crashes** as emergent, entangled states
- **Flash crashes** and systemic risk
- **Tail risks** and correlations missed by classical models

### Risk Analysis

- Quantum probability models can better capture **fat tails** in return distributions
- More accurate modeling of **extreme events** and **correlation breakdowns**
- Improved **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** and **Conditional VaR** calculations

## Quantum Game Theory

### Extended Game Theory

In classical game theory, strategies are single-valued. Quantum game theory extends this:

- **Quantum strategies** can be in superposition—allowing new Nash equilibria
- Players can use quantum entanglement to achieve cooperative solutions impossible in classical games
- New equilibria emerge that are inaccessible to classical players

### Applications to Economics

1. **Auctions**: Quantum strategies may enable new bidding behaviors
2. **Bargaining**: Entanglement can facilitate cooperation
3. **Market Competition**: Quantum game theory predicts outcomes that differ from classical predictions
4. **Oligopoly Models**: New strategic possibilities in Cournot and Bertrand competition

### Prisoner's Dilemma

The quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma shows:

- Entangled strategies can escape the classical Nash equilibrium
- Cooperation becomes possible without communication
- Demonstrates the power of quantum correlations in strategic settings

## David Orrell's Contributions

### Money as a Quantum Phenomenon

David Orrell's book *Quantum Economics: The New Science of Money* (2018) is a foundational text in the field. His key insights:

#### 1. Wave-Particle Duality

Money has **dual nature**:

- **Physical**: Coins, notes, tangible objects
- **Virtual**: Abstract value, ledger entries, digital currency
- Like light behaving as both wave and particle

#### 2. Measurement and Value

- The value of an asset is **not intrinsic** but defined only through transaction (measurement)
- Prior to transaction, value exists as a **superposition of possibilities**
- At the moment of exchange, possibilities "collapse" into a price

#### 3. Entanglement of Agents

- Debts, contracts, and networks tie economic actors together
- Classical theory cannot adequately describe these interconnections
- Financial crises propagate through entangled networks

#### 4. Money as Magic/Alchemy

- The value of money is a **collective belief**—a "spell" that transforms paper or digits into economic power
- This explains both its **power** (enabling complex economies) and **fragility** (vulnerable to loss of confidence)

#### 5. Critique of Mainstream Economics

- Classical economics focuses on **scarcity**, not money itself
- A true "science of money" must account for:
  - **Uncertainty**
  - **Entanglement**
  - **Emergence**
- Economy is better modeled as a **complex system** than a mechanical equilibrium

## Challenges and Critiques

### Metaphor vs. Reality

**Critique**: Are quantum principles useful as metaphors for complexity, or is there a literal quantum mechanism at work?

**Response**: Most "quantum economics" is **metaphorical**—harnessing the math, not claiming that markets are quantum physical systems. The mathematics of quantum mechanics provides powerful tools even without literal quantum effects.

### Empirical Validation

**Challenge**: The field is nascent; many models await rigorous empirical testing

**Status**: 
- Some QDT models have shown empirical success in laboratory experiments
- Large-scale market validation is ongoing
- More data and testing needed

### Computational Limitations

**Issue**: True quantum speedups require hardware not yet mature

**Current State**:
- NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era restricts applications
- Hybrid quantum-classical approaches show promise
- Full quantum advantage still years away for most applications

### Interdisciplinary Barriers

**Problem**: Economics and physics have different:
- Methodological traditions
- Standards of evidence
- Publication cultures

**Solution**: Need for more interdisciplinary collaboration and training

### Risk of Oversimplification

**Concern**: Quantum analogies, if pushed too far, risk being:
- Superficial
- Misleading
- Unfalsifiable

**Mitigation**: Rigorous mathematical formulation and empirical testing

## Connection to Game Strategy

The principles of quantum economics are particularly relevant to strategic decision-making in games like Slay the Spire:

- **Uncertainty**: Card draws, enemy encounters, and event outcomes create fundamental unpredictability
- **Superposition of strategies**: Players must maintain multiple possible deck archetypes until key cards/relics are acquired
- **Measurement effects**: The act of choosing cards changes the deck state and future possibilities
- **Entanglement**: Card synergies create interconnected effects where one card's value depends on others
- **Probabilistic reasoning**: Optimal play requires reasoning about probability distributions, not deterministic outcomes

These parallels make Slay the Spire an interesting testbed for exploring quantum-inspired decision-making algorithms.
